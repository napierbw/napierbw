### Hi there ğŸ‘‹

<!--
**napierbw/napierbw** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- ğŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on the numerous small projects I've amassed over the years as I await the start of my job with CarMax.
- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning D3.js
- ğŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on any sort of project that interests me but I'm particularly open to anyone who wants to write scenes for text-based games that I create.
- ğŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with finding some new data to explore using my knowledge of data science.
- ğŸ’¬ Ask me about anything! I love to help answer questions and get to know new people!
- ğŸ“« How to reach me: napierbw51@gmail.com
- ğŸ˜„ Pronouns: He/Him/His
- âš¡ Fun fact: An accomplishment I'm particularly proud of is a greenhouse that still stands by my former high school. I helped with designing, advocating, and growing the first plants for the greenhouse. https://www.progress-index.com/news/20160902/colonial-heights-high-school-opens-new-greenhouse
