### Hi how are ya 👋

- 🔭 I’m currently working on the numerous small projects I've amassed over the years as I await the start of my job with CarMax.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning D3.js
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on any sort of project that interests me but I'm particularly open to anyone who wants to write scenes for text-based games that I create.
- 🤔 I’m looking for help with finding some new data to explore using my knowledge of data science.
- 💬 Ask me about anything! I love to help answer questions and get to know new people!
- 📫 How to reach me: napierbw51@gmail.com
- 😄 Pronouns: He/Him/His
- ⚡ Fun fact: An accomplishment I'm particularly proud of is a greenhouse that still stands by my former high school. I helped with designing, advocating, and growing the first plants for the greenhouse. https://www.progress-index.com/news/20160902/colonial-heights-high-school-opens-new-greenhouse
